              <p>McLaren Automotive is a British automotive manufacturer based at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, Surrey. The main products of the company are sports cars, usually produced in-house at designated production facilities. In July 2017, McLaren Automotive became a 100% owned subsidiary of the wider McLaren Group.</p>

                The McLaren 650S was launched in 2014 at the Geneva Motor Show and is available in both Coupé and Spider derivatives. Both the Coupé and Spider models feature the same 3.8-litre twin-turbo M838T V8 engine, producing 641 bhp (478 kW; 650 PS) and 500 lb⋅ft (678 N⋅m) of torque.[16] However, because of the Spider's higher weight (1,370 kg (3,020 lb) versus 1,330 kg (2,932 lb) of the coupé), the performance numbers are a bit different. According to the manufacturer the coupé    accelerates from a standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.0 seconds and 200 km/h (124 mph) in 8.4 seconds with a maximum speed of 333 km/h (207 mph). On the other hand, the Spider, again according to the manufacturer, reaches 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.0 seconds and 200 km/h (124 mph) in 8.6 seconds with a maximum speed of 329 km/h (204 mph). The 650S features a range of Formula 1 inspired technologies such as a carbon fibre MonoCell chassis, optimized powertrain, braking and suspension systems, mid-engine architecture, carbon ceramic brake discs, and active aerodynamics.
                With McLaren's design ethos of “form follows function”[17] in mind, the 650S design is inspired by the McLaren P1 which results in more downforce generated by the vehicle.
