                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                  i first started out learning how to code from a website named <strong>code academy</strong>
                  I started with <u>java</u> then gave up on it after realising that I wasn't understanding
                  Then i got into <u>c#</u> because i really wanted to learn the art of creating games
                  but i gave up on it because there was inadequate learning material.I then went back to codeacademy
                  and finished my first course it was a <u>javascript</u> course.I then learnt html because javascript
                  is pretty useless without <u>html</u> that led me to <u>css</u> i had to restart css a couple of times
                  before understanding it.I figured that building something wiould lead me to research more on code.
                  so i thought of a social website.Through the process of building it I stumbled upon <u>express.js</u>
                  i learnt about <u>npm</u> and understood that express was a npm package.I continued to learn about firebase.
                  Circunstances led me to give up on firebase.After putting some thought into the project, i came up with my logic.
                  It worked well i uploaded images ,i was able to use web sockets and HTTP requests etc.but the website was really slow
                  and was really bugy.So idecided to go back to codeacademy abd learn some native languages.I learnt <u> Java and C++</u>
                  but code academy centered more on understanding the syntax and learning material for native languages is hard to find online
                  .So i never understood how to build phone apps with java or c++.That led me to finding a languages <u>react native and apache cordova</u>
                  but apache cordova and <u>ionic</u> were not recommended in building phone apps. so i stuck to react native.It was easy to understand but
                  half way through i read that some native device capabilities were not available yet on react native.That was when a friend of mine
                  introduced me to angular.I havent read angular i just wached some tutorials of <u>typescript</u> online.it is pretty much like javascript
                  if you dont include all the crazy imports and exports.I stuck to <u>angular</u> and that led me to <u>nativescript</u> and it had 100% native device capability
                  i decided to learn <u>nativescript</u> which is also pretty similar to react native
                </p>

                        does not know code.I used <u><em>Typescript , html , css , and im planning to use node as a server side language</em></u> The link is below.
